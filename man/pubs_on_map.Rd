\usage{
pubs_on_map(
  pubs,
  city_gc,
  zoom = c("world", "europe", "usa"),
  facet_by = "none",
  n_top = Inf,
  ncol = 3,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{pubs}{A data frame with at least these columns:
\describe{
  \item{journal}{Name of the journal of the paper.}
  \item{year}{Year when the paper was published.}
}
There must be one row per publication or per method or species for each title
if faceting by those. If facetting, then a column whose name is the value in
`facet_by` must be present.}

\item{city_gc}{From geocode_inst_city}

\item{zoom}{Whether to plot the world map or only Europe (centered on Western
Europe and some Eastern European countries are partially cropped off) or only
the US.}

\item{facet_by}{Name of a column for facetting.}

\item{n_top}{Number of categories with the most publications to plot in facets;
the other categories are lumped into "other".}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns in facetted plot.}

\item{label_cities}{Logical, whether to label cities. In facetted plots, cities
are not labeled to reduce clutter.}

\item{n_label}{Number of top cities to label, so the labels won't clutter the
plot.}

\item{per_year}{Logical, whether to do the count for each year separately.
This is for making animations with gganimate.}

\value{
A ggplot2 object

\description{
Plots points on a map, and the areas of the points are proportional to the
number of publications at the location. Can facet by some category like
method or species.
}
\details{
World map will use the Robinson projection. European map uses the LAEA Europe
projection (EPSG:3035), and the American map uses the US National Atlas Equal Area
projection (EPSG:2163) and Alaska and Hawaii are moved and included. The option
to zoom in on Europe and the US is available because those are the two regions
of the world with the most publications and it's hard to see the data when
plotted on a world map.
