Welcome to the Museum of Spatial Transcriptomics! This package contains functions and notebooks used to analyze the metadata of a curated database of literature in spatial transcriptomics. The analyses and the function documentations can be read on the `pkgdown` website of this package. To make the analysis transparent, we put this repository on RStudio Cloud; you can change parameters and even change the code. The analysis notebooks are in the `vignettes` directory. The LCM text mining notebooks that take longer to run are in the `inst` directory.

The analyses are generally broken down by type of spatial technology, in addition to "prequel" technologies (i.e. in situ hybridization atlases) and data analysis publications.
