Welcome to the Museum of Spatial Transcriptomics! This package contains functions and notebooks used to analyze the metadata of a curated database of literature in spatial transcriptomics. The analyses and the function documentations can be read on the [`pkgdown` website of this package](https://pachterlab.github.io/museumst/). The LCM text mining notebooks that take longer to run are in the `data-raw` directory. The analysis notebooks that were in the vignettes directory have been moved into a separate repo, [`LP_2021`](https://github.com/pachterlab/LP_2021/tree/main/supplement), organized into a [`bookdown` site](https://pachterlab.github.io/LP_2021/). To make the analysis transparent, we put the analyses on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/project/2492054); you can change parameters and even change the code. 

The analyses are generally broken down by type of spatial technology, in addition to "prequel" technologies (i.e. in situ hybridization atlases) and data analysis publications.

The analyses can be explored on RStudio Cloud: https://rstudio.cloud/project/2492054
The database can be accessed here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sJDb9B7AtYmfKv4-m8XR7uc3XXw_k4kGSout8cqZ8bY/edit?usp=sharing
