Welcome to the Museum of Spatial Transcriptomics! This package contains functions and notebooks used to analyze the metadata of a curated database of literature in spatial transcriptomics. The analyses and the function documentations can be read on the `pkgdown` website of this package. To make the analysis transparent, we put this repository on RStudio Cloud; you can change parameters and even change the code. The LCM text mining notebooks that take longer to run are in the `data-raw` directory. The analysis notebooks that were in the vignettes directory have been moved into a separate repo, [`museumst_catalog`](https://github.com/pachterlab/museumst_catalogue), to be organized into a `bookdown` site.

The analyses are generally broken down by type of spatial technology, in addition to "prequel" technologies (i.e. in situ hybridization atlases) and data analysis publications.

The analyses can be explored on RStudio Cloud: https://rstudio.cloud/project/1325402
The database can be accessed here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sJDb9B7AtYmfKv4-m8XR7uc3XXw_k4kGSout8cqZ8bY/edit?usp=sharing
